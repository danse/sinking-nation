# Vertical value corresponding to an area percentage

With reference to the drawing.

The profile of a semicircle is described by `sin(arccos(x))` which [is
equivalent][trig] to `sqrt(1 - x^2)`, where `sqrt` is the square
root. Try to [plot][plot] this function if you have doubts.

The indefinite integral of `sqrt(1 - x^2)` given by Wolfram Alpha is
`(x Sqrt[1 - x^2] + ArcSin[x])/2 + constant`, i multiply it for two
because the function is an emisphere. The constant is Ï€/2. The final
plottable function is `pi/2 + (x*sqrt(1-x^2)+asin(x))`.

The function looks very close to linear, so a linear scale can
probably be used as a good approximation. Otherwise, the function has
to be inverted in order to be used.
